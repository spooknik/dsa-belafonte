# A repo for DSA - Belafonte stuff
I'm putting all of my artwork and layouts for my keyset DSA - Belafonte in this repo. 
The project has been put on hold for now, due to not enough interest and I will not come back to it for some time, if ever. 
So for this who want to make it happen or use my work as a starting point or in another project, then you are welcome to it. 

I firmly believe that by allow other people to use your work a greater end product can be achieve as a whole. So i'm licensing everything under The MIT License. The TL;DR is you can use this for whatever you wish, i'm not liable for anything.
